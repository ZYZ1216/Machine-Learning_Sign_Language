We use the Sign Language Digits Dataset that was created by researchers in Turkey. The dataset was prepared by 218 Turkish high school students, and each student provided 10 images. In total, 2180 images were collected for classification of American Sign Language Digits.

# Final result discussion

1. The very high accuracy for kNN and random forest model might be due to the tuning of hyperparameter k and n. For example: kNN with 20 features and k=1: Accuracy = 0.9909.
2. Also, the relatively small datasets may contribute to high accuracy.
3. Moreover, the feature selection process (like mRMR) can more effectively identify the most relevant features, improving model performance.
